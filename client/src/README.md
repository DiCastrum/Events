# Modifications after the end time of the acessment

- README.md file
- On forms date is now on a Date/Time format, previous was text.
- Creating new events are only allowed on current day or after, not able to create on days that already pass.
- Other events now render all events, previous was only 2 because I thought from the picture that was only to show 2.
- Now events are filtered to only show events that still need to happen, previous was showing all events even the ones that already had a past date.
- Css improved.
